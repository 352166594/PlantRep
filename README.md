# PlantRep: a resource of plant repeats

This project include the analyse method and the open website of the repeat.

The analyse script as this webiste show.


The open website is at ftp://ftp.agis.org.cn/PlantRep/, including:
(1)Consensus sequences:recreated from a multiple alignment of individual genomic copies from which each ancestral nucleotide can be inferred based on a majority-rule along the alignment.;
(2)Seed alignments: a profile Hidden Markov Model for each consensus sequences;
(3)Repeat annonation: a detailed annotation of the repeats that are present in the query sequence;
(4)Intact LTR annonation:a detailed annotation of the Intact LTR.
